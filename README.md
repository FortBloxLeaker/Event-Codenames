# FortBlox Event Codenames
You can use the FortBlox Event Codename to trigger the event early!<br>
I have looked into how this works and there is a folder named `Events`<br>
Which is probably used for the Event scripts. Ill give a example below on<br>
To Trigger the Events<br><br>
Example: `Workspace.Events.DestroyerEvent.Disabled = false`<br><br>
You should click 'F9' or open a executer and put in this command and it<br>
should usually trigger the event. Just beware that some Events can bug if they<br>
delete event assets
