# FortBlox Event Codenames

Operation Strike: `DestroyerEvent` (OLD CODENAME, REASON: CHANGED NAME)<br>
New Operation Strike: `StrikeDestroyer` (OLD CODENAME REASON: REMADE MAP.)

<br><br>
ATTENTION: I do not recommend using these commands anymore<br>
They have just started implementing anti-cheats to counter-act these commands<br>
from working. We will have a new method someday but for now these will not work<br>
on the new island as for how it is implemented and the events are sepreate maps now<br>
instead of on the main island.
